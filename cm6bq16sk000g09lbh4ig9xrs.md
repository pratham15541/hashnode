When sharing your project on GitHub, choosing the right license is crucial. The license defines how others can use, modify, and distribute your code. In this blog, we’ll explore the most common licenses available, their key features, and when and where to use which license.

When you share your work on GitHub, it’s important to specify how others can use it. This is where licensing comes in. A license not only protects your rights but also provides clear guidelines for others to use, modify, and share your work.

In this blog, you’ll learn about different licensing options for both software and non-software projects. By the end, you’ll know how to pick the right license for your needs.

## Why Licenses Are Important

Licenses are essential because they define what others can and cannot do with your project. Without a license, others can’t legally copy, modify, or distribute your work. A clear license helps you avoid legal issues and sets expectations for how your project can be used.

GitHub is a popular platform for developers and creators to share their work. Whether you’re writing code, creating documentation, or sharing creative assets, choosing the right license ensures your work is used the way you intend.

## Common Licenses for Software Projects

Here’s an overview of popular software licenses:

| **License** | **What It Allows** | **Usage Conditions** | **Examples** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MIT License** | Permissive and simple. Allows modification, distribution, and commercial use. | Requires attribution and including the license text. | Great for open-source projects that encourage widespread use. |
| **Apache 2.0** | Similar to MIT but includes explicit patent rights. | Requires attribution and documentation of changes. | Used in large open-source projects needing patent protection, e.g., Hadoop. |
| **GPL (General Public License)** | Requires derivative works to use the same license. Ensures all modified versions remain open-source. | All changes must be open-source and licensed under GPL. | Ideal for projects prioritizing openness, e.g., Linux Kernel. |
| **LGPL (Lesser GPL)** | A weaker version of GPL that allows linking with proprietary software. | Only modifications to the LGPL parts must be open-source. | Commonly used for libraries like GTK+. |
| **BSD (2-Clause, 3-Clause)** | Permissive and simple. Allows almost unrestricted use, with minimal conditions. | Requires attribution; some versions restrict using the author’s name. | Used in academic and lightweight projects, e.g., FreeBSD. |
| **Mozilla Public License 2.0** | Requires changes to MPL-licensed files to remain open-source but allows linking with proprietary code. | Modifications to MPL files must be disclosed; other files can have any license. | Ideal for balancing openness with commercial use, e.g., Firefox. |
| **Unlicense** | Dedicates the project to the public domain, allowing unrestricted use. | No conditions or attribution required (optional). | Suitable for projects where the creator rejects copyright. |
| **Proprietary License** | Restricts use, modification, and redistribution based on terms set by the creator. | Users must follow the specific terms of the license. | Used for private repositories or projects with restricted sharing. |

## Common Licenses for Non-Software Projects

Licenses aren’t just for code. Non-software projects like documentation, art, and videos also need clear permissions. Here are some common options:

| **License** | **What It Allows** | **Usage Conditions** | **Examples** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Creative Commons (CC)** | A flexible license framework. You can allow reuse, remixing, or sharing with conditions like attribution or no derivatives. | Varies based on the chosen CC license (e.g., CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC BY-NC). | Ideal for documentation, artwork, and educational materials. |
| **GFDL** | Ensures free access to documentation. Requires attribution and share-alike for modifications. | Must include license text and provide attribution. | Used for manuals and knowledge-sharing projects, e.g., Wikipedia. |
| **Public Domain (CC0)** | Releases work into the public domain, allowing unrestricted use, modification, and sharing. | No conditions or attribution required. | Suitable for datasets, public reports, and content meant for unrestricted sharing. |

## How to Choose the Right License

Picking a license depends on your goals. Here are some scenarios:

* **Want broad usage with minimal conditions?** Use MIT or BSD.
    
* **Want contributions and openness?** Choose GPL or Apache.
    
* **Want to protect documentation or media?** Go for Creative Commons.
